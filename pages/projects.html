                    the stress of maintaining balance. The game used random images and invisible obstacles to symbolize life's unpredictability 
                    and the need for mental wellness.

                    For this datathon, we were provided several data sets and had to find a correlation and present it. My group won first place against 14 other amazing teams! 
                    My group, focused on health data between 2016-2021 and how lack of sleep from both adults and students causes students to have a 
                    lower chance of graduation. Using Python, Streamlit, and other data visualization tools, we showcased the strong correlation between lack of sleep and graduation 
                    levels, as well as how the more food insecure or lower income of a household, the more likely they were to have lower sleep levels.

                <p class="project_description">In 2020, when the world shut down, I turned to art as a way to occupy my time and find peace. I explored various creative projects, 
                    including painting trashcans, crocheting blankets, and drawing. Meanwhile, my godmother turned to writing. Together, we collaborated on a children's book titled 
                    Max and the Bed Sillies, inspired by her grandson and his love of stuffed animals. Once she completed the story, she sent it to me, and I created illustrations 
                    that aligned with the story's aesthetic. Despite being in North Carolina while she was in Pennsylvania, we worked digitally, which became a special way to stay 
                    connected through creativity during a difficult time. The book was available on the Barnes & Noble Press website from September 2020 to 2024.

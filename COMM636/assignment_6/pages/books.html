            <p>Coming March 18, 2025
                <br>
                <br>
                Step back into the world of Panem, twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games. 
                Sunrise on the Reaping explores the morning of the reaping for the Fiftieth Hunger Games, 
                also known as the Second Quarter Quell. This new chapter delves into themes of propaganda, 
                power, and the ease with which the many are governed by the few. Inspired by David Hume's 
                reflections on submission and control, Suzanne Collins crafts a thought-provoking narrative 
                that challenges readers to confront the question: Real or not real?

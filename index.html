<p><div class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence, otherwise known as AI, is a hot topic in the technological field. One recent thing I have learned
    about and been fascinated with is the idea of artificial intelligence being used within the classroom (especially for children with disabilities both learning and physical).
   What first intrigued me with this topic is that my older brother has multiple learning disabilites and he loves technology. Had more advanced technology been involved in his 
   K-12 Education I'm sure he would have loved it and been more excited and encouraged to learn. The first article I found about it can be accessed by <a 
   href="https://www.thetechedvocate.org/using-artificial-intelligence-help-students-learning-disabilities-learn/">clicking here!</a> 
   This specific article written by the Tech Advocate describes how the AI can present material to students who struggle with readining advanced texts, 
   it can also help educators identify and discover if a child may present signs of a learning disability. AI can also help students get more consistent and reliable feedback. One of the 
   most highlighted aspects of AI in the classroom is how it can collect useful data for teachers. This data can point out areas where teaching isnâ€™t effective or subjects where 
   the majority of students are struggling. This also allows educators to have a better understanding at how students with learning disabilities are truly doing in comparison to their peers. 
   Here are some other articles that also go into more examples and details of how AI can and is being used to help students with 
   learning disabilities in the classroom: <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2022/6/3-ways-ai-can-help-students-with-disabilities"> 3 Ways AI Can Help Students with Disabilities

   There are several other articles discussing this similar topic. For instance, if you are interested in learning more about how students with physical disabilities 
   are using AI you can read more <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/people-with-disabilities-use-ai-to-improve-their-lives/"> here.</a></div></p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence, otherwise known as AI, is a hot topic in the technological field. One recent thing I have learned
    about and been fascinated with is the idea of artificial intelligence being used within the classroom (especially for children with disabilities both learning and physical).
   What first intrigued me with this topic is that my older brother has multiple learning disabilites and he loves technology. Had more advanced technology been involved in his 
   K-12 Education I'm sure he would have loved it and been more excited and encouraged to learn. The first article I found about it can be accessed by <a

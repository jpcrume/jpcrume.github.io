                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Julia Crume (she/her/hers)! I’m currently a senior at UNC, on track to graduate in May 2025, pursuing a double major in Information and Library Science (B.S.)
                     and Communications (B.A.) with a concentration in New Media. I am passionate about technical writing, data analysis, UI/UX design, web development, and reducing
                     the gender gap in STEM fields. Throughout my time at UNC, I’ve successfully balanced school, work, and extracurriculars all related to my carrer and interests, 
                     including STEM Sisters, FEMMES, the Student Tech Council, and peer tutoring. <br>
                    <br>I have two years of corporate experience managing content, migrating data, and producing professional documentation, along with proficiency in industry-standard 
                    tools and software. My employers have praised me for my collaborative attitude and problem-solving abilities. I’m currently seeking opportunities to further develop 
                    and apply my technical and communication skills in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.

                <p>
                    Hi, I am Julia (she/her/hers)! I'm originally from Mooresville, NC and currently a senior at UNC, on track to graduate May 2025.
                    I am a highly motivated double major in Information and Library Science (B.S.) and Communications (B.A.)
                    with a concentration in New Media. I'm passionate about technical writing, web development, and data
                    analysis. I have experience managing content, migrating data, and producing professional
                    documentation for two years now. I have experience with industry-standard tools and software. I have been praised by my employers 
                    for my collaborative attitude and problem-solving skills. I am currently seeking opportunities to further develop and apply my
                    technical and communication skills in a fast-paced environment.
